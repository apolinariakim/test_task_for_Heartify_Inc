# test_task_for_Heartify_Inc
test task for Heartify Inc by Polina Kim

Hi! To get acquainted with my performance of the test task, open and run the file ltv_calculation_functions.ipynb

Also my notebook is presented in the HTML version. You can run the file ltv_calculation_functions.html (doesn't require a python compiler or any pre-installed files)
Attention: the interactivity of charts is not preserved in the HTML version, graphs in the HTML version are static (like the image)
